Our research studies students' mathmatic abilities in New York. 
In our research, we quote 5 different data sets from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/ including Math Test Results 2006-2012 - District - Ethnicity, Math Test Results 2006-2012 - District - Gender, Math Test Results 2006-2012 - District - all students, SAT result of schools in all 32 districts and the attendency of schools in these districts. By combining these data sets, we hope that we could found whether students gender and ethnicity make a conciderable difference on their mathmatic abilities. After taking these factors into consideration, we hope to found a parttern of how one's attendancy in school could make a difference on this matter. At last, we'd hope to decide schools in which districts have the highest quality of mathmatic education.
